## Dash Mechanic

### Overview

The dash ability is a directional teleport that moves the player rapidly in their facing direction. It combines collision detection, particle effects, velocity application, and an automatic grab-on-contact feature.

### Algorithm

The dash executes through the following phases:

#### Phase 1: Raytracing
```
1. Start from player eye location + initial_offset_y
2. Trace along player facing direction
3. Check for collisions every step_size blocks
4. Stop at first solid block OR max_distance
```

**Collision Detection**:
- Uses cylindrical hitbox with radius `Config.Movement.DASH_RAY_HITBOX_RADIUS` (0.7 blocks)
- Checks blocks with offset `Config.Movement.DASH_IMPEDANCE_CHECK_OFFSET_Y` (0.5 blocks up)
- Respects passable blocks (air, grass, flowers)

#### Phase 2: Velocity Application

The dash applies velocity in two components:

**Horizontal Velocity**:
```
velocity_horizontal = direction * distance * forward_multiplier * base_power
```
Where:
- `direction` = player facing direction (normalized)
- `distance` = actual dash distance (blocks)
- `forward_multiplier` = `Config.Movement.DASH_FORWARD_MULTIPLIER` (0.5)
- `base_power` = `Config.Movement.DASH_BASE_POWER` (0.7)

**Vertical Velocity**:
```
velocity_vertical = (distance * upward_multiplier + upward_boost) * base_power
```
Where:
- `upward_multiplier` = `Config.Movement.DASH_UPWARD_MULTIPLIER` (0.15)
- `upward_boost` = `Config.Movement.DASH_UPWARD_BOOST` (0.05)

**Velocity Damping** (applied per tick):
```
velocity *= damping_factor
```
Where `damping_factor` = `Config.Movement.DASH_VELOCITY_DAMPING` (0.6)

#### Phase 3: Grab Detection

After dash execution, the system checks for grabbable entities:

```
grab_radius = sqrt(DASH_GRAB_DISTANCE_SQUARED)
              = sqrt(8.5) ≈ 2.9 blocks
```

Entities within this radius are pulled toward the player using the grab mechanic.

#### Phase 4: Visual Effects

**Particle Trail**:
- Spawns `Config.Movement.DASH_PARTICLE_COUNT` (100) particles
- Spread: X=1.25, Y=1.25, Z=1.25 blocks
- Updates every `Config.Movement.DASH_PARTICLE_TASK_PERIOD` (2 ticks)

**Sound Effects**:
- **Flap Sound**: Volume 0.6, Pitch 1.0 (whoosh effect)
- **Sweep Sound**: Volume 0.3, Pitch 0.6 (trail effect)

### Design Rationale

**Why Distance-Based Velocity?**
- Longer dashes feel more impactful
- Prevents overpowered short-range dashing
- Creates risk/reward: longer dash = harder to control

**Why Upward Boost?**
- Prevents players from getting stuck on edges
- Makes dash feel more fluid and forgiving
- Enables creative vertical movement

**Why Velocity Damping?**
- Prevents infinite sliding
- Gives player control back quickly
- Reduces collision glitches from high speeds

## Toss Mechanic

### Overview

The toss ability throws the player's sword in an arc trajectory. The sword becomes a physics-based projectile that deals damage on impact and explodes.

### Trajectory Calculation

The toss uses a **two-phase arc trajectory**:

#### Phase 1: Upward Launch
```
iterations = TOSS_UPWARD_PHASE_ITERATIONS (2)
velocity_y = TOSS_UPWARD_VELOCITY_Y (0.25 blocks/tick)

For i = 0 to iterations:
    position.y += velocity_y
```

**Purpose**: Creates initial upward arc for visual appeal and clearance.

#### Phase 2: Forward Projectile
```
iterations = TOSS_FORWARD_PHASE_ITERATIONS (3)
base_force = TOSS_BASE_FORCE (1.5 blocks/tick)
might_multiplier = TOSS_MIGHT_MULTIPLIER_BASE + (might_level * INCREMENT)
                 = 2.5 + (might_level * 0.1)

velocity = player_facing * base_force * might_multiplier
```

**Might Scaling**:
| Might Level | Multiplier | Effective Force |
|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| 0           | 2.5        | 3.75 blocks/tick |
| 5           | 3.0        | 4.50 blocks/tick |
| 10          | 3.5        | 5.25 blocks/tick |

### Damage Calculation

The toss damage is **velocity-based**:

```
damage = BASE_THROWN_DAMAGE + (item_velocity_magnitude * ITEM_VELOCITY_MULTIPLIER)
       = 12.0 HP + (velocity * 1.5)
```

**Additional Damage Factors**:
- **Sword Damage Multiplier**: 1.0× (full item damage applies)
- **Shard Damage**: 2 base shards
- **Toughness Damage**: 30.0 HP
- **Soulfire Reduction**: 5.0 points

### Explosion Mechanics

On impact, the toss creates an explosion:

```
explosion_power = TOSS_EXPLOSION_POWER (2.0)
set_fire = Config.World.EXPLOSIONS_SET_FIRE (false)
break_blocks = Config.World.EXPLOSIONS_BREAK_BLOCKS (false)
```

**Knockback**:
```
knockback = explosion_direction * TOSS_KNOCKBACK_MULTIPLIER (0.3)
```

### Animation

The toss includes a visual wind-up animation:

```
animation_iterations = TOSS_ANIMATION_ITERATIONS (15)
location_offset = player_facing * TOSS_LOCATION_OFFSET_MULTIPLIER (0.3)
particle_height = player_height * TOSS_PARTICLE_HEIGHT_MULTIPLIER (0.5)
```

This creates a circular particle effect around the player during the throw.

### Design Rationale

**Why Two-Phase Trajectory?**
- Initial upward arc looks more natural
- Prevents instant ground collision
- Allows throws over obstacles

**Why Velocity-Based Damage?**
- Rewards longer throws (more time to accelerate)
- Creates skill ceiling for optimal throw angle
- Makes gravity/trajectory settings meaningful

**Why Explosion on Impact?**
- Clear visual feedback for hit
- Area-of-effect for grouped enemies
- Satisfying feedback for successful throw

## Grab Mechanic

### Overview

The grab ability pulls nearby entities toward the player using continuous force application.

### Force Application

```
pull_direction = normalize(player_position - entity_position)
pull_force = pull_direction * GRAB_PULL_STRENGTH
           = pull_direction * 0.8 blocks/tick

entity_velocity += pull_force
```

Applied every tick for `Config.Movement.GRAB_HOLD_DURATION` (40 ticks = 2 seconds).

### Range Detection

```
max_range = GRAB_MAX_RANGE (3.0 blocks)

Entities within sphere of radius max_range are affected.
```

### Integration with Dash

The dash automatically triggers grab on entities within grab range:

```
if (dash_completed && entity_within_grab_radius):
    apply_grab(entity)
```

This creates a **"dash-grab" combo** where dashing through enemies pulls them along.

### Design Rationale

**Why Continuous Force?**
- Allows entity to maintain some momentum
- Feels more natural than instant teleport
- Can be counteracted by player movement

**Why Limited Duration?**
- Prevents permanent entity locking
- Creates timing window for follow-up attacks
- Balances the ability's power

**Why Integrate with Dash?**
- Creates satisfying combat flow
- Rewards aggressive dash usage
- Enables gap-closing against fleeing enemies
